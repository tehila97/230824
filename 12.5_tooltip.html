        Lorem Ipsum is simply <p custom-tooltip="testing a custom tooltip" class="tooltip">dummy</p> text of the printing and typesetting industry. 
        Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s,
        when an unknown printer <p custom-tooltip="testing a custom tooltip" class="tooltip">took</p> a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book.
        It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
        remaining essentially unchanged. It was<p custom-tooltip="testing a custom tooltip" class="tooltip">popularised</p>  in the 1960s with the release of
        Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
        software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
